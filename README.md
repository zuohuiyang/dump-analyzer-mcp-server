# MCP Server for WinDbg Crash Analysis

A Model Context Protocol server that bridges AI models with WinDbg for crash dump analysis and remote debugging.

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.svnscha/mcp-windbg -->

## Overview

This MCP server integrates with [CDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/opening-a-crash-dump-file-using-cdb) to enable AI models to analyze Windows crash dumps and connect to remote debugging sessions using WinDbg/CDB.

## What is this?

An AI-powered tool that bridges LLMs with WinDbg for crash dump analysis and live debugging. Execute debugger commands through natural language queries like *"Show me the call stack and explain this access violation"*.

## What This is Not

Not a magical auto-fix solution. It's a Python wrapper around CDB that leverages LLM knowledge to assist with debugging.

## Usage Modes

- **Crash Dump Analysis**: Examine Windows crash dumps
- **Live Debugging**: Connect to remote debugging targets
- **Directory Analysis**: Process multiple dumps for patterns

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows with [Debugging Tools for Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) or [WinDbg from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pgjgd53tn86).
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Any MCP-compatible client (GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf etc.)
- Configure MCP server in your chosen client

> [!TIP]
> In enterprise environments, MCP server usage might be restricted by organizational policies. Check with your IT team about AI tool usage and ensure you have the necessary permissions before proceeding.

### Installation
```bash
pip install mcp-windbg
```

## Transport Options

The MCP server supports multiple transport protocols:

| Transport | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `stdio` (default) | Standard input/output | Local MCP clients like VS Code, Claude Desktop |
| `streamable-http` | Streamable HTTP | Modern HTTP clients with bidirectional streaming |

### Starting with Different Transports

**Standard I/O (default):**
```bash
mcp-windbg
# or explicitly
mcp-windbg --transport stdio
```

**Streamable HTTP:**
```bash
mcp-windbg --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`

The HTTP transport also enables binary dump uploads through `PUT /uploads/dumps/{session_id}` after calling `create_upload_session`.

### Command Line Options

```
--transport {stdio,streamable-http}  Transport protocol (default: stdio)
--host HOST                              HTTP server host (default: 127.0.0.1)
--port PORT                              HTTP server port (default: 8000)
--cdb-path PATH                          Custom path to cdb.exe
--symbols-path PATH                      Custom symbols path
--timeout SECONDS                        Command timeout (default: 30)
--verbose                                Enable verbose output
```


## Configuration for Visual Studio Code

To make MCP servers available in all your workspaces, use the global user configuration:

1. Press `F1`, type `>` and select **MCP: Open User Configuration**.
2. Paste the following JSON snippet into your user configuration:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "mcp_windbg": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "mcp_windbg"],
            "env": {
                "_NT_SYMBOL_PATH": "SRV*C:\\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This enables MCP Windbg in any workspace, without needing a local `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

### HTTP Transport Configuration

For scenarios where you need to run the MCP server separately (e.g., remote access, shared server, or debugging the server itself), you can use the HTTP transport:

**1. Start the server manually:**
```bash
python -m mcp_windbg --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**2. Configure VS Code to connect via HTTP:**
```json
{
    "servers": {
        "mcp_windbg_http": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
        }
    }
}
```

> **Workspace-specific and alternative configuration**: See [Installation documentation](https://github.com/svnscha/mcp-windbg/wiki/Installation) for details on configuring Claude Desktop, Cline, and other clients, or for workspace-only setup.

Once configured, restart your MCP client and start debugging:

```
Analyze the crash dump at C:\dumps\app.dmp
```

### Upload Workflow

Upload-based dump analysis is available when the server runs with `streamable-http`.

The upload workflow is only available over the `streamable-http` transport.
The `session_id` variants of `open_windbg_dump`, `run_windbg_cmd`, and `close_windbg_dump` are only exposed in that transport mode.

1. Call `create_upload_session` with a supported dump file name such as `crash.dmp`, `crash.mdmp`, or `crash.hdmp`
2. Read `upload_path` from the tool result and combine it with your MCP server base URL
3. Upload the raw dump bytes with `PUT {server_base_url}{upload_path}`
4. Reuse the uploaded dump with `open_windbg_dump(session_id=...)`
5. Use `run_windbg_cmd(session_id=...)` for follow-up debugger commands when needed
6. Call `close_windbg_dump(session_id=...)` when analysis is complete

`create_upload_session` returns `upload_path`, which is the HTTP path exposed by this server for the binary `PUT` upload. Clients should combine it with the externally reachable server base URL.

The server stores uploads under `WINDBG_UPLOAD_DIR` using a unique prefix plus the original file name, for example `abc123-crash.mdmp`.

Upload session behavior:

- A successful upload stays available until it expires or `close_windbg_dump(session_id=...)` is called.
- Accessing an expired uploaded session fails and the server cleans up its temporary resources.
- `close_windbg_dump(session_id=...)` is rejected while the session is uploading or being analyzed by `open_windbg_dump` / `run_windbg_cmd`.
- Failed uploads delete the temporary dump and invalidate the `session_id` immediately. Clients must create a new upload session before retrying.

### Upload Environment Variables

These options are primarily relevant for the `streamable-http` transport:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `WINDBG_UPLOAD_DIR` | Directory used for temporary uploaded dump storage | `%PROGRAMDATA%\mcp-windbg\uploads` or the system temp directory |
| `WINDBG_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | Maximum accepted upload size in megabytes | `100` |
| `WINDBG_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | Time-to-live for inactive upload sessions | `1800` |
| `WINDBG_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` | Maximum number of active upload sessions | `10` |

## MCP Compatibility

This server implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), making it compatible with any MCP-enabled client:

The beauty of MCP is that you write the server once, and it works everywhere. Choose your favorite AI assistant!
