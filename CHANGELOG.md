# Changelog

All notable changes to the MCP Server for WinDbg Crash Analysis project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **HTTP Dump Upload Workflow**: Added upload sessions for `streamable-http` clients so crash dumps can be transferred with `PUT /uploads/dumps/{session_id}` and then analyzed via `open_windbg_dump(session_id=...)` or `run_windbg_cmd(session_id=...)`

### Changed

- **Upload Session Contract**: Renamed the upload session response field from `upload_url` to `upload_path` to reflect that the server returns the HTTP upload path exposed by the streamable HTTP server

### Fixed

- **Upload Session Cleanup**: Clean up failed upload sessions immediately, reject expired uploaded sessions on access, and allow expired stale uploading sessions to be reclaimed safely

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Live Debugger Break-In**: Added the `send_ctrl_break` tool to interrupt an active CDB/WinDbg session with CTRL+BREAK for dump and remote debugging workflows (#40)

### Changed

- **Dependency Refresh**: Updated runtime dependency floors for `mcp`, `pydantic`, `starlette`, and `uvicorn`, and refreshed test and validation tooling versions in `pyproject.toml`
- **CI Dependency Maintenance**: Updated GitHub Actions dependencies for Python setup and artifact handling in release workflows (#39, #42)

### Fixed

- **Registry Compatibility**: Restored MCP registry compatibility by reverting `server.json` to the supported `2025-10-17` schema version
- **Publishing Workflow**: Adjusted MCP publishing workflows to match current registry publisher behavior

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed

- **Registry Schema Migration**: Updated MCP server schema from deprecated `2025-10-17` to current `2025-12-11` version for mcp-publisher compatibility

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **HTTP Transport in Registry**: Added `streamable-http` transport configuration to server.json for MCP registry discovery
- **Schema Validation in CI**: New `validate-server-schema.py` script validates server.json against the official MCP schema

### Fixed

- **Registry Schema Update**: Updated MCP server schema version from 2025-09-29 to 2025-10-17 for compatibility with registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- **CI Cache Warning**: Disabled unnecessary dependency caching in PyPI publish job to eliminate spurious warnings

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **HTTP Transport Support**: New `--transport streamable-http` option enables HTTP-based communication alongside the default stdio transport (#31)
- **MCP Prompt API**: Implemented prompt templates for AI-assisted crash dump triage and analysis (#25)

### Changed

- **Updated Dependencies**: Bumped `mcp` to 1.17.0, `pydantic` to 2.12.0, and other dependencies (#26)
- **Improved Prompt Templates**: Removed hard-coded model references from prompt templates for better flexibility (#29)
- **Updated Dependabot Configuration**: Improved automated dependency update settings

### Fixed

- **Session Cleanup**: Prevent stale debugging sessions if `.shutdown()` fails (#28)

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-10

**What's New in This Release**

This release focuses on making mcp-windbg more reliable, faster, and easier to use for everyone - from beginners to advanced users.

### New Features

**Core**
- Live debugging session support via `open_windbg_remote` and `close_windbg_remote`
- Extended dump file support for `.mdmp` and `.hdmp` formats
- Microsoft Store WinDbg CDB compatibility

**Devops**
- Set up continuous integration that automatically tests the code with Python versions 3.10 through 3.14
- Added automatic dependency updates to keep everything secure and up-to-date
- Streamlined the release process so new versions reach users faster

**Development**
- Switched to `uv` - a lightning-fast Python package manager that's 10-100x faster than pip
- Development setup is now much quicker with commands like `uv sync` and `uv run`
- More reliable builds with locked dependency versions

**Documentation**
- Added comprehensive debugging instructions for AI assistants ([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md))
- Created structured templates to help analyze crash dumps more effectively ([`.github/prompts/dump-triage.prompt.md`](.github/prompts/dump-triage.prompt.md))
- All documentation is now available in the [repository Wiki](https://github.com/svnscha/mcp-windbg/wiki) for easy access
- Simplified the main [`README.md`](README.md) to focus on getting started quickly
- Added this structured [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) to track all project changes

### Improvements

**Performance Boost**: Build times are significantly faster thanks to the new tooling
**Enhanced Security**: Automatic scanning and updates keep dependencies secure
